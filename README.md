# KDD-Intrusion-Detection-Task
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders.  The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between "bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good'' normal connections.

# Dataset : 
http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

# Attack categories :
1) DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;

2) R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;

3) U2R:  unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various ``buffer overflow'' attacks;

4) probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.
